Dataset brief description 
Statistical information regarding files and access pattern to files in one of Yahoo cluster 

Information for the Data Review Committee 
How was the data collected? 
In one of Yahoo grid(dilithium-gold), used hadoop command (hadoop dfs –lsr) to collect stats for file, and analyze auditlog to identify access pattern for each file 

What is its source? 
Name node and Audit log in dilithium-gold 

How was it anonymized? 
This data set contains only aggregated/statistical information, and doesn’t contain any privacy-related information. Thus, not anonymized 

What is the goal in releasing this data to researchers? 
To provide data about real file access pattern to a researcher in order to help the researcher develop methods to address issues on hadoop infrastructure and encourage them to publish papers to share new findings among hadoop community. 


Public-friendly" dataset description 
This dataset contains total number of files, total file size, number of file accesses, number of days between the first access and the most recent access, file distribution, deletion rate of files and directories, creation rate of files and directories in a dilithium-gold cluster.
